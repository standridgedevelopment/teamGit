				<div class="p mb-4">Hello! My name is Isaiah Standridge! I am a tenor, soon-to-be father, and aspiring software developer. I am quick-learning, adaptable, and steady. </div>
				<p>In highschool I began work as a busser. I trained as a server and continued to support myself through College. I eventually worked my way up to my most recent position as a Service Manager. </p>
				<p>As a service manager, I was responsible for overseeing and managing the schedule, the training, and service standards of 50+ employees. </p>
				<p>I also have a strong sales background as well. I was a sales agent at Geico for two years. I found huge success there and spent my time as a top sales agent.</p>				 
				<p>As a soon-to-be father, I have decided on a new career path. I left my management career and joined the Eleven Fifty Academy. At Eleven Fifty Academy, I've already become proficient C# and SQL databases. I've also had a strong focus on HTML and CSS.</p>
