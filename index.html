                <div class="p mb-4">I am a hard working individual with a passion for code. Prior to my coding venture I
                    worked in logistics for over five years. While I enjoyed many aspects of my time in logistics and am
                    very grateful for the experience I gained, it was not where I really wanted to be. In the evenings
                    and on weekends I would spend my time reading about and practicing code. I realized that this is
                    where my passion lies, so I decided to pursue it with all of my intent. I enrolled in Eleven Fifty
                    Academy so that I could learn the best ways to code, as well as how to work as a part of a
                    development team.</p>
